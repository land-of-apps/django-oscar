Compare the provided diff with the plan. Analyze the diff for potential problems. 

Don't instruct the user to review changes and determine for themselves if there are
problems. Just point out problems that you can see.

Don't comment on code style.

Conduct your review at the design level, not the code level. Avoid mentioning
specific lines of code or code snippets, because the user hasn't read the code
yet. They want an overview of the changes, before they read the code.

Produce a checklist output in the following format:

## Planned changes

- [ ] Changes in the diff that are implemented as-planned

## Unplanned changes

- [ ] Changes in the diff that were not planned

## Possible issues

- [ ] List of possible issues
