# Exclusive voucher offers are not exclusive

## Issue Summary

When you create two new offers with the voucher offer type and make it exclusive, it's still possible to add both to your basket.
Though reproducing was a bit strange, as it depends on the order you're adding the voucher.

I had to add my latest created voucher first and then the first one I created. The other way around resulted in an message that it wasn't possible to add that voucher to my basket.

## Steps to Reproduce

* Create two offers, both exclusive and with the "voucher" type.
* Create two vouchers, link one to the first offer you created and one to the second one
* Try adding them both to your basket, try it in two ways: 1. Add voucher one and then voucher two 2. Add voucher two and then voucher one
* You'll see the voucher can be applied twice, even though it's exclusive
